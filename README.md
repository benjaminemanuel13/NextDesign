# Next Game Designer

Have the Sprites, 8x8 Tiles and 16x16 Tiles saving to DB and generating correctly ready to insert into your sajmplus Assembly projects.

May be z88dk compatible (I can't remember the db lines struture in z88dk but would be easy to tweek)

TileMap designer next to do, though I might do the assembly generation (skeleton game with sprites and tiles from here) next.

[Edit 16/08/2025]

Have added capability to add new Sprites, 8x8 Tiles and 16x16 Tiles which save in DB when added.

[Edit 18/08/2025]

The sprite, tile8 and tile16 forms populate from default data but you can't actually edit/save them without clicking on them in the Project Window.  Once selected it enables the Save button on the form.
