# Next Game Deigner

Have the Sprites, 8x8 Tiles and 16x16 Tiles saving to DB and generating correctly ready to insert into your sajmplus Assembly projects.

May be z88dk compatible (I can't remember the db lines struture in z88dk but would be easy to tweek)

TileMap designer next to do, though I might do the assembly generation (skeleton game with sprites and tiles from here) next.
